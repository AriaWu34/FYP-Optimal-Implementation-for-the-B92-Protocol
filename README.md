# How to Run

Execute `b92_collective_attack.ipynb` and `b92_individual_attack.ipynb` to generate results and plots.

Run `collective_vs_individual.ipynb` to compare collective and individual attacks.

## Data Files

- `collective_attack.csv` and `individual_attack.csv` contain pre-generated results.
- Running notebooks will **overwrite** these files if different parameters are used.

## Experimental Notebook

- `b92_3states.ipynb` is **incomplete** and serves as a framework for future work.

## Requirements

Install Python 3, Jupyter Notebook, and dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas sympy jupyter
